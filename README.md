<ul>
  <li>Code is available on GitHub, written in Swift, and compiles.</li>
  <li>Makes use of protocols and inheritance such that code is clean and (somewhat) extensible</li>
  <li>Uses enums for Error types, Mgr. Types, Emp. Types or Guest Types. <b>Makes use of associated values for cleaner or more elegant code.</b></li>
  <li>Errors are created using enums, are thrown at appropriate times and carry informative messages.</li>
  <li>Creates one or more swipe methods to handle access to areas, rides, skips and discounts. Methods should return bools, or appropriate results, not throw errors when access is denied. <b>Makes use of clever polymorphic or dynamic code for highly reusable swiping</b></li>
  <li>Creates (and comments out) a complete set of plug values such that all entrant types and most errors can be tested. <b>Creates a truly exhaustive set of plug values which allows for testing of all entrant types and ALL reasonable error paths</b></li>
  <li>Uses expressive variable/method names and sufficiently descriptive comments.</li>
  <li><b>Student successfully implement at least two of the requirements marked below as "Extra Credit."</b></li>
  <li><b>All entrants are correctly alerted on their birthday, if they have one entered, all other entrants are handled gracefully</b></li>
  <li><b>All swipes are appropriately accompanied by a “ding” or “buzz”</b></li>
  <li><b>Entrants are gracefully prevented from swiping twice consecutively</b></li>
</ul>
